Musso.int,’ unlike Hitler, is not doctrinaire or sectarian.
He is not “a man possessed,” but a kind of modern con-
dottiere, and an opportunist politician, who might have
climbed high in any abnormal situation. Deeply influenced
by Sorel and, like Sorel, a believer in violence and aware of
the immense power of myths over the human mind; endowed
with a sure and instinctive understanding of his own people,
and with exceptional histrionic gifts, he is one of the ablest

. of modern rulers and one of the greatest of modern dema-

gogues. His capacity for transforming millions of men and
women into a mob, and then dominating that mob with

‘monumental, vulgar masculinity while directing the policy

/of the nation with cunning statesmanship, is altogether un-
surpassed. He is capable of deep and sudden transformations.
There can be few political opinions which he has not held at
one time or another, though his preference has always been
for the violent and the extreme. His past and present utter-
ances are no index of his future actions.

One thing seems certain, that Mussolini is not religious,
though he is realistic enough to see in religion a formidable
and, possibly, a useful power. In this he is unlike Lenin and
Hitler, who are religious to the point of monomania—which
is the chief reason why they are fundamentally unchangeable,
