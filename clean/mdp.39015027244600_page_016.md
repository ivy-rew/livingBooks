rebellion amongst the large Hungarian and the smaller Ger-
man minorities, try to achieve an ascendancy over Rumania
that would place her rich supplies of raw material, especially
oil, at his disposal.

Nor will Poland, the Baltic States, and Russia be able to
elude the German challenge.

A month ago it seemed that the Spanish civil war might go
on for another year, or even more, and perhaps end incon-
clusively. But for the first time General Franco and his Ger-
man and Italian auxiliaries have been able to concentrate
enough artillery and bombing squadrons to create the equiva-
lent of a creeping barrage against which the best infantry
in the world would be helpless. The Spanish Government
and their French and international auxiliaries are far too ill-
supplied with artillery and aeroplanes to carry out a counter-
concentration.

It may be that, if General Franco wins the war, the German
and Italian troops will leave. But the German and Italian
political and commercial agents, their military, technical,
and administrative experts, their institutes and educational
establishments, their subsidized newspapers, their propa-
gandists, their open and secret clubs and societies, will re-
main. For a long time to come, Spain will be under German
and Italian influence.

England and France will be compelled to develop a
counter-influence, for even the discreetest ascendancy of any
foreign Powers in Spain threatens one of the main arterial
systems of the British Commonwealth and of the French
Empire.

The end of the civil war is, therefore, not the end of the
Spanish problem. When the fighting has ceased, that prob-
lem will be reopened in all its historic gravity.
