Accorninc to Engels, the only “real” and “historical right”
is “the right to revolution.” Whatever promotes revolution,
therefore, is right, and whatever hinders revolution is wrong.
Successful revolution is the only ultimate sanction of moral-
ity. It did not occur to Marx and Engels that the “bourgeois”
revolutions of the past were by no means over. They re-
garded the “proletariat” as the only “revolutionary” class.
To the proletarian, according to the Communist Manifesto,
“law, morality, religion, are...so many bourgeois preju-
dices.” The only good, therefore, is what is good for the pro-
letarian revolution—the only evil is what is bad for that
revolution.?

Hitler’s conception of good and evil is analogous. National
Socialists do not tire of repeating that “what is right is what
serves the interests of the German nation.”* Hitler identifies
the racial principles with the “will of God,” as we have seen.
Nothing matters to him except race.* Throughout his book,
throughout his innumerable speeches, and pervading all his
actions, is the fanatical belief that whatever will promote his
revolution and establish the blood-brotherhood of the Greater
Germany is right, and that this revolution is the only ulti-
mate sanction of morality.
