Marxism—The conflict of “opposites”—Marxian dogma a subjective myth—
The Marxian goal of Heaven on Earth—The “final and decisive battle’—The
ferocity and complacency of the Marxian vision—Marxism and reform—Marx-
ism and the “petit bourgeois”’—Fundamental resemblance between Marxism
and National Socialism—The debt of National Socialism to Marxism—The two
secular religions compared—The “withering away” of the State—Marxian ethics
as spurious as Marxian science.

Lenin held that every revolutionary movement must have “a.

revolutionary theory.” * He held that the Marxian “theory”
not only serves a revolutionary purpose as no other theory
can, but that it is “true” by e every philosophical, _ scien-
tific, and “objective” test. But if we examine the_M Marxian
“theory,” we find it is not a theory at all, or even a na hypothe-
sis. Te has no philosophical ar-scientific validity whatever and
breaks down under every “objective” test. Iisa myth, or, to
give modern myths their modern name, an “ideology.” |.

The conglomerate of dogma, doctrine, precept, and exege-
sis known as “Marxism,” professes to reveal not only man’s
true destiny, but also the way he can—and must—achieve the
fulfillment of that destiny in the universal dominion of equal-
ity, freedom, justice, and well-being: in the Kingdom of
Heaven on Earth.

Marxism claims not only to be true, but to be the Truth.
It denies any salvation or way of salvation other than revealed
by Karl Marx and his friend, Friedrich Engels.

earsism is therelovey 2 religion. But, in so far as it con-
ceives the “perfect state” as being of this world, in so far as its
Kingdom of Heaven is on Earth, it is a secular religion.

The supposedly philosophical content of the Marxian
myth, or rather the central myth itself, which is known as
“dialectical materialism,” is represented by Marxists as being
a revolutionary advance on the Hegelian “dialectic.”
