# CHAPTER II

The attainment of the Millennium—The myth of Marxism and of National
Socialism—Their pseudo-philosophical and pseudo-scientific character—Lenin
and Hitler, a comparison of their beliefs and methods—Lenin obsessed by the
reality of class, Hitler by the reality of race—Lenin a would-be destroyer of,
Hitler a corrupter of, religion—Hitler’s fundamental doctrine of the “Greater
Germany”—His mission to achieve that end—His identification of racial prin-
ciples with the “will of God”—His attitude towards class—The difference be-
tween Marxian and National Socialist economics.

Tue Millennium of modern secular eschatology has nothing
in common with the past or the present—or with history, for
its beginning is the end of history. But history cannot end,
save with the annihilation of mankind. There can be no
Millennium save in the doom of all. That is why the Millen-
nium is unattainable in this world, for no matter how allur-
ing it is made to appear with the help of pseudo-religious,
pseudo-philosophical, pseudo-scientific mythology; no matter
how ruthless the extermination of all heresy: the suicidal
nature of every secular eschatology will be made manifest in
time, and men will cry “Halt” before the edge of doom is
reached. The present will assert itself once more and peace
will be concluded with the past. And the name of that peace
is ‘“Tradition.”

Every transcendental eschatology proclaims the end-of this
world. But secular eschatology is always caught in-its.own
contradiction. _It projects into the past a vision of what-never
was, it conceives what. is in terms of what is not, and the
future in terms of what.can never be, The remoter past
becomes a mystical or mythical Age of Innocence, a Golden
or a Heroic Age, an age of Primitive Communism or of
resplendent manly Virtue. The future is the Classless Society,
Eternal Peace, or Salvation by Race—the Kingdom of Heaven
on Earth. The present is always the Fall.
