The next morning Ellen was awake
and staring, wide-eyed, at the dawn,
long before the maids, in the faint light,
went yawning down to the kitchen.

It seemed, when she awoke, as though
some terrible dream had oppressed her,
and she felt for a moment that sense of
wondering relief, which grown persons
know too well, and that fades so in-
stantly into miserable certainty. Ellen,
with a frightened sigh, remembered ; and
then buried her face in her pillow, and
felt the tears behind her eyes, though no
tears came. Older persons know this
pain, too. For relief, the child began to
think of what she had promised to do.
