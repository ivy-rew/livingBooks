Effie, who said her head ached too
much for study, was leaning out of
the school-room window, kicking her toes
against the wainscoting, while she waited
for Ellen to finish the thwd declension.
“Do hurry up with your old vegzbuses,”
she called over her shoulder, and a mo-
ment later seized Ellen’s hand and went
skipping from the room, much to the
relief of weary Miss Dace.

Effie had a suggestion to make: “Let’s
go down to the back parlor and play house
under the sofa.”

“Won't it make your head ache more?”
Ellen said, faintly polite, for playing house
under the sofa was great happiness.
