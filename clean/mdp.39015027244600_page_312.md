296 UNTO OAESAR

2 The task of the German agents in Palestine is to work up
Pan-Islamic feeling against the Jews and the English. Money,
propaganda, and arms are placed at their disposal. The German
calculation is, that if unrest or disorder can be created, England
will have to dispatch troops who will, therefore, be unavajlable
in Europe if she is at war with Germany (vide the letters ex-
changed by the German Ministers of War and of Propaganda
on this subject and quoted in the Manchester Guardian of the
15th January 1938).

33 “Yea, who ever knew conferences in so great oppositions to
ripen kindly, and bring any fruit to perfection? For many come
rather for faction than satisfaction, resolving to carry home the
same opinions they brought with them.” (Thomas Fuller, Holy
War.)

2¢ It is, of course, mainly a matter of opinion whether a people
are insular in mind or not. All the peoples living under “totali-
tarian” Governments are condemned to insularity. The English
are certainly much less insular now than they were before the
war. They seem to me less insular than the French (though there
is some truth in Voltaire’s observation that “just as England is
an island, so every Englishman is an island”). Perhaps the least
insular person in the world is the educated Scandinavian.

2° At the time of writing (February 1938), the so-called “reform
of the League” (or rather of the Covenant) is sur le tapis. Any
reform of the League is difficult because of the large number
of members with conflicting interests. It would, of course, be
best if the “‘sanctionist” articles (especially Article 16) were re-
formed out of existence. But the Covenant is so elastic and has
so many loopholes (especially since it was amended in April
1921), that, with a certain amount of evasion and agility, it is
possible for members of the League to refrain from applying
“sanctions” if they wish to! The question of reform is, therefore,
not one of very great urgency. Nevertheless, it is desirable that
all clauses authorizing coercive measures should be removed from
the Covenant some time or other.
