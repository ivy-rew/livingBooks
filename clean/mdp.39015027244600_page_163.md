The influence of Versailles in the National Socialist Revolution—The power-
ful sense of German unity—German civilization—The foreshadowing of Na-
tional Socialism—Its background in German history—The territorial settlement
at Versailles—Germany’s post-Treaty position—The essential aspiration of the
Third Realm is the establishment of a Pan-American hegemony—The impli-

history of the Third Realm, Versailles is but an incident and
the Great War but an episode. a

~ Versailles les might “have been better and it might have been
much worse. Some conquerors have been more generous than
were the Allied and Associated Powers, but most have been

much that is politically unsound.

It is always difficult to say what would have happened if
something else had not happened. Versailles postponed the
German nationalist revival. A more lenient treaty could not

entire German people, a revolutionary movement of national
and social “liberation” from the “chains of Versailles” and of
“Capitalism,” a movement resembling the National Socialism
