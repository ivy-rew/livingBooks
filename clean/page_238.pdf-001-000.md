226 The Story of a Child

You will not say I must go away again?
We have our own lives to live; please
tell me I may stay, ma’am? Oh, I hope
youre not angry that I have come back ?”’
“Angry?” said Miss Jane, her lips
trembling and her eyes smiling. ‘Oh,
why should I be, Mr. Dove? Why —
I” — There was a crumpled letter in her
hand, and she put it up to her face to hide
her tears, and then laid it in his hands,
with a gesture as lovely and as impulsive
as a girl’s. I’m glad you’ve come back ;
you must never leave me any more
They had both forgotten Ellen.
