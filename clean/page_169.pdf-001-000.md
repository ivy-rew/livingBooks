The sun poured hot and white upon
the long stretch of sandy road. Ellen
had hurried through the village, and, as it
chanced, met no one. Near the post-
office, on the main street, she saw a fa-
miliar figure which gave her an instant’s
fear. It was Miss Jane Temple; she had
a letter in her hand, and seemed to be
reading its address, with absent intent-
ness ; she never once looked up. Escaped
from those friendly eyes, Ellen was soon
beyond Old Chester.

She walked steadily, and quite rapidly ;
she passed two or three people ; one man,
who knew her, said, “ Hullo, Ellen!” in
a surprised way, but asked no questions.
