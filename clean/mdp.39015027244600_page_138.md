Social Democracy in Germany—Its achievement—The revolution of 1918—The
danger of territorial disruption—The Treaty of Versailles and the German
Republic—The stand made by the Social Democrats and the Trade Unions—
The defeat of Social Democracy—Reasons for this defeat—The part played by
the Soviet Union—Communism and National Socialism.

Tue failure of the German Republic was the failure of
German Social Democracy. Although the Social Democrats
never had a majority, never dominated the Republic, and
never ruled except in coalition, it was they above all who
gave the State its specifically republican and democratic char-
acter. They fell with the Republic and the Republic fell with
them before the combined forces of Muscovite Communism
and National Socialism.

Marxism was to the Social Democrats a kind of conven-
tional religion, but not an imperious dogma that must be
translated into action as immediate and complete as possible.
The strength of the Social Democrat is that he has so little
true Marxism—his weakness that he has so much. Having so
little, he is capable of pragmatic thought and of practical
constructive effort within the framework of a social order
which he theoretically opposes and tries to reform rather
than destroy. But his acceptance of Marxism as a “theory,”
a “philosophy,” a “Weltanschauung,” that explains all social
phenomena and throws doubt on all that is not materialistic,
condemns him to superficiality.

For religion, the Communist has a contemptuous intaler-
ance, the Social Democrat a contemptuous_tolerance. The

‘ Social Democrat believes—or believed—that man, or at least
the “working man,” is by nature good, and that all will be
well somehow or other, and that, in any case, the kind of
nonsense Hitler talks will never impress “the workers,” how-
ever much it may appeal to the stupid ‘“‘bourgeois.”’*
