# Chronicle III: THE RIGHT EYE

> 
> The created soul of man hath two eyes. The one is the power
> of seeing into eternity, the other of seeing into time and the
> creatures, of perceiving how they differ from each other as
> afore-said, of giving life and needful things to the body, and
> ordering and governing it for the best. But these two eyes of
> the soul of man cannot both perform their work at once; but
> if the soul shall see with the right eye into eternity, then the
> left eye must close itself and refrain from working, and be as
> though it were dead.
