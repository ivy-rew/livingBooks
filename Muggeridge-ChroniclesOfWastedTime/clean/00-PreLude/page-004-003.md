THE MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE SOCIETY

The Malcolm Muggeridge Society was founded on the 100th
anniversary of the birth of Malcolm Muggeridge and some thirteen
years after his death. This coincided with a successful two-day seminar
entitled ‘Muggeridge Rediscovered’ held at Wheaton College, Illinois
in May 2003, bringing together people from many parts of the world
with an interest in the work of Malcolm Muggeridge — his life and
his times.

The aims of the Society can be summarised as follows:

* Providing information for those researching the life and work of
Malcolm Muggeridge
* Keeping writings in print and to encourage the publication of
new critiques and scholarship
* Providing fellowship and virtual forum for admirers to discuss
Muggeridge’s work
* Publishing a regular newsletter
* Facilitating republication of his books and publication of

unpublished material

* Providing linkage with other societies where mutual interest
exists
* Increasing awareness of papers, writings and other memorabilia
held in Special Collections at Wheaton College, Illinois
* Developing a web presence
* Organising social, dramatic and literary events
* Encouraging new writing about Muggeridge

In preserving and utilising the literary and broadcast legacy, the
Society provides a focus for those wishing to learn more about this
famous author, journalist, soldier-spy, broadcaster, and Christian
apologist. The Society publishes a quarterly literary journal called
The Gargoyle, distributed to members.
